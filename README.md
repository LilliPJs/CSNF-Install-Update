## **<u>Optional but recommended</u>**

## **<u>Another optional thing</u>**

If you wish to have my basic settings that include my audio, video, and keybinds, etc. grab the "options.txt" file from the drive folder and put it in the root folder of the pack. (You can get to the packs folder my clicking "Open Folder" on the instance.

## **<u>Updating the pack</u>**

1.  Rename the old version of the pack (Under "Edit Instance") to something you can remember

2.  Grab the latest version of the pack and follow steps 3 and 4.

3.  Once done, click "Open Folder" on the old instance, find "options.txt" and copy it.

4.  After that click "Open Folder" on the new instance and paste it in there.

<u>If you want to save any saves, screenshots, shaderpacks, etc. you can also move the respective folders over as well. The only folders you shouldn't copy over are "mods" and "config".</u>

<sub>Updating the pack shouldn't have to be this difficult but CurseForge really had to tell me that the modloader and mods aren't compatible.. Kinda what I get for using Neoforge on 1.20.1 I guess...</sub>
